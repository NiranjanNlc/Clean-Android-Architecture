**Take a layered approach to writing clean, testable, and decoupled Android applications**

## What is this book about?

As an application’s codebase increases, it becomes harder for developers to maintain existing features and introduce new ones. In this clean architecture book, you'll learn to identify when and how this problem emerges and how to structure your code to overcome it.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Discover and solve issues in Android legacy applications
* Become well versed with the principles behind clean architecture
* Get to grips with writing loosely coupled and testable code
* Find out how to structure an application’s code in separate layers
* Understand the role each layer plays in keeping the application clean
* Integrate existing frameworks and libraries for each layer
